function
: a relationship of an input to an output. Where the input variable depends on another variable (output). An example would be f(x) with x being the input

operator precedence
: a rule of precedence in Python guides the order in which opeartion is carried out

command line interface
: allows you to work with the operating system and maniuplate files 

docstring
: a comment at the beginning of a function that clarifies the types of the parameters andreturn value, and the purpose of the function; optionally, other documentation of the function maybe addedstubbed function (or stub)a function with an empty body (except for return or pass or somethingsimilar), although often with a docstring (especially in CS103); effectively a function you know youwant to write but have not gotten around to yet (a common feature in the early stages of codedevelopment)

assertion
: a statement in code that something should be true; an assertion uses an assert statementwhich has the syntax in Pythonassert (<condition>)orassert <condition>; if the conditionis true, execution of the code continues normally; if the condition is false, execution of the code ishalted immediately with a diagnostic messagetest datadata that is fed into function calls to explore the behaviour and correctness of your functions;actually test data really involves a pair: the input data and the known output on this input.

scalar
: something with magnitude; examples of scalars are integers, rational numbers, and reals (inPython, ints and floats)

vector
: something with direction and magnitude; an example of a vector is a translation (a relativemotion from here to there along a straight line, such as pushing a box), the normal vector at apoint of a surface (the vector perpendicular to the surface at that point), and forces in physics(e.g., force of gravity: direction is toward the center of the earth, magnitude is the gravitationalconstant)

representation of a vector in 2-space
: (x,y) where x and y are scalars

rectilinear square
: a square isrectilinearif its sides are aligned with the coordinate axes(so two sides will be horizontal, two sides vertical)

equilateral triangle
: a triangle whose sides are all the same length;equivalently, a triangle whose angles are all the same (soÏ€/3
