exercise 0: interpreting code
0.0 - Similar to math, programming also follows the order of operations for mathematical expressions. 2+3*4 is 14 and not 20 because multiplication has higher precedence than addition.
0.1 - Within the official Python documentation, section 6.16. ‘Operator Precedence’ has the documentation for this concept.
0.2 - 6/2/3 is 1.0 because Python simply reads and runs left to right when there is no difference/higher precedence. The other choice for this value, if we had used a different rule could be 0.25 if the computer read and ran it from right to left - dividing 3/2 first then by 6.

exercise 1: functions
teaser - A function is the purpose of a thing or person.
1.0 - A function defined in mathematics is a relationship of an input to an output. Where the input variable depends on another variable (output). An example would be f(x) with x being the input. According to Merriam-Webster, there are 7 different definitions for the noun function and 2 different definitions for the verb function.
1.1 - Sine [sin(x)], Cosine [cos(x)], and Tangent [tan(x)] are three common functions used in trigonometry. The x represents an angle (degrees or radians) of a right-angled triangle to ratios of two side lengths. Linear function is a function that can be expressed in a linear expression to graph straight lines [f(x)=mx+b or y=mx+b]. f(x) is the input and the domain and range are real numbers. Quadratic functions [f(x)=ax^2+bx+c or y=ax^2+bx+c] are used to graph parabolas (curve). Quadratic functions are functions where the highest power in the function is two and the location of the graph is determined by the constants (a,b,c,...). The sign of the probable would either provide an open-up or open-down parabola graph.
